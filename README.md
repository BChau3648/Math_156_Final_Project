## Training the Model

The main code to run is the [training.ipynb](training/training_cnn.ipynb) notebook inside the training folder. It imports the convolutional neural network (CNN) model from the [model.py](model/cnn.py) module and the dataset from [preprocessing.py](preprocessing/preprocessing.py).
